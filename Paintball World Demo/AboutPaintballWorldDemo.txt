About Paintball World Demo:

I wanted to showcase level design in a fun, first person shooter concept level. This level showcases interactable objects only if the projectile, not the player, hits
the object. There are also enemies that are fully animated. Sadly, I could not find free attack animations when making this project. As such, I did not include a combat
system. However, there is a defeat trigger hit box should the player fall off the platforms.
